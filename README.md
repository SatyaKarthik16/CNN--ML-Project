## Getting Started
Agriculture employs about a third of the global workforce, however, this number is steadily
declining due to farmer financial losses. One of the main causes of this financial loss is a lack
of agricultural technology. Continuous cropping and fertilizer overuse reduces soil productivity
and have a negative impact on the ecosystem. Industrial agriculture uses modern technology
and equipment to process different levels of agriculture such as identifying soil properties and,
crop and water management. The work is to demonstrate how Machine Learning based models
can be used to improve crop production by predicting various factors such as Soil type, crop
and fertilizer recommendation and plant leaf disease prediction. The analysis work includes
implementing various machine learning and neural network models. The work explains how to
determine the soil type from images, predicting plant leaf disease, as well as cropping and
fertilization suggestions based on relevant data. Cloud integration for monitoring the data and
making necessary predictions. So, this work mainly focuses on how neural network techniques
automate various decisions which include critical human thinking and an application
demonstrating the functioning of the entire pipeline.
